### üíª Ignite Shop
Sale of ignite shop t-shirts using Stripe's API to store/consume information, as well as redirection to make payment for items.
The objective was to create an e-commerce, which is integrated with Stripe. It was very important to consolidate knowledge in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). 
The project was entirely developed by me, only the design was provided by Rocktseat through figma. Developed with both React/NextJS documentation, which gave me a lot of knowledge, beyond what was necessary to solve the challenge.
